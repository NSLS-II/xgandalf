[optional]  If you want to use an own (newer) version of Eigen,
            download latest version of eigen3 from eigen.tuxfamily.org/ 
            and install it using cmake.
            If Eigen3 is not found automatically (and the internal one is used), 
            add -DEigen3_DIR=<path to Eigen3Config.cmake> to cmake invocation

            
Create directory where to build (e.g. cmakeBuild/).
cd into it
Call cmake <directory of this file>

If you want to install in a place other than the standard 
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX (e.g. if you do not have root rights), 
use -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install path>

Typical usecase on Linux with GCC:
> mkdir cmakeBuild
> cd cmakeBuild
> cmake ..
> make 
> make install

In the installation folder you'll find the headers. 
Add the folder "include" and "Eigen/Eigen" to your include path.
